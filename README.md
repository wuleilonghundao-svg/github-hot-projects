How It Works
- Searches repositories via GitHub REST API.
- Ranks by stars gained within the configured window (fallback: stars for newly created repos).
- Outputs a Markdown ranking and machine-readable JSON.

Config
- See `gh_hot/config.yml` for languages and window days.
- Override via env vars: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_HOT_LANGS`, `GH_HOT_DAYS`, `GH_HOT_TOP_N`, `GH_HOT_USE_GROWTH`.

Automation
- See `.github/workflows/daily.yml` for a daily schedule that runs the generator and commits updates.
